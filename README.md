# C++ Code Repository

Welcome to my C++ programming archive! This repository is a personal collection of code snippets, problem solutions, and mini-projects written in C++. It's a space where I explore different aspects of the language—ranging from basic syntax to more advanced data structures and algorithms.

## 🔧 Contents

- 📌 **Beginner Programs** – Simple input/output, control structures, and loops  
- 🔁 **Functions and Recursion** – Modular code and recursive problem solving  
- 📊 **Data Structures** – Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees  
- 💡 **Algorithms** – Searching, sorting, and other problem-solving strategies  
- 📂 **Object-Oriented Programming** – Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- 🚀 **Projects** – Small-to-medium scale projects demonstrating real-world logic

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as both:
- A **learning journal**, documenting my growth as a C++ programmer  
- A **reference library**, useful for quick lookup or reuse of code  

## 🛠️ Tools

- Language: C++ (mostly C++17/C++20 standard)
- Compiler: GCC / Clang / MSVC depending on environment

## 📈 Future Goals

- Add more real-world examples and challenges  
- Optimize existing code for performance and readability  
- Collaborate with others and accept constructive feedback

## 🤝 Contributions

I'm open to ideas, pull requests, or improvements! Feel free to fork this repo and experiment.
